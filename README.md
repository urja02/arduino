Calibration plays an important role in industries today. Its primary significance is to maintain accuracy, standardization and repeatability in measurements, assuring reliable benchmarks and results. Ultrasonic sensor is used in a wide range of industries like tank levelling, Vehicle detection for car wash industry, Distance measurement, Robotic sensing etc., thus making it necessary to calibrate the sensor. Servo motor can be used for the same purpose since its the most economical way to do so. Storing data in cloud for easy access in the future can be done using IOT and ThingSpeak.
